When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    Fill in your answer here
    Once a given functionality is fully verified and when I would like to collaborate, share my work with other developers, I will push my commits to remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Answer: Git will not be able to identify the correct logical points in the development cycle for "pull". It may end up pulling changes that may not work properly. Hence it is best left to the developer to decide the right time to push changes into the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Fork is a github specific method to clone a pre-existing repository on github's servers. This is a way for you to create a clone of a repository owned by someone else for which you are not a contributor to contribute.
    Clone is a git command to clone a remote respository on to your local manchine
    Branch is a label in your git repository for you to develop some new feature which is not fully ready for production yet!

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    The advantage is being able to identify the changes that may have been happening on the remote repository at a later point and being able to merge all those changes to the local master branch before pushing the changes back to the remote repository
